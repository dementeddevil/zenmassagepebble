# Zen Massage for Pebble

Zen Massage for Pebble Smartwatch application is a smartwatch app that links up with the Zen Massage Android application and the Zen Massage web-site.

This app is ultimately designed for massage therapists and allows the therapist to track appointments and during a consultation the watch can be configured to issue vibrations to notify how long the treatment session has lasted including a vibration 15 minutes before a session is due to end.

Appointments would be added as timeline pins for supported smartwatches.
